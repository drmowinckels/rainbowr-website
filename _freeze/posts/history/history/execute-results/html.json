It was in that moment that Ben realised that he was talking to a fellow gay person. useR!2017 was large - around 1000 attendees - and knowing that he had found someone with this in common made the scale of the conference less overwhelming. He had a sense of community within the larger R community.\n\nThe following day Ben broached Ella with the idea formalising an LGBTQ+ community for R users and she leapt at the idea. Along with Erin LeDell and a couple of other conference attendees that they knew to be part of this community, they pitched the idea to Heather Turner and Kevin O'Brien from [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), who fully supported it.\n\nAfter the conference, Ben and Ella, with input from Erin (who came up with the name RainbowR) and Heather, quickly went about building the community, establishing the [Slack group](https://rainbowr.slack.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ) account. Soon there were 60 people in the Slack. Conversations started and members used it both to share ideas online and meet in person at other conferences and events.\n\nTDOR.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(distilltools)\nicon_link(\n  icon = \"images\", #fas fa-images\n  text = \"slides\",\n  url = \"https://ellakaye.github.io/Rladies-Coventry-getting-help-in-R/getting_help_in_R.html#1\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<a href=\"https://ellakaye.github.io/Rladies-Coventry-getting-help-in-R/getting_help_in_R.html#1\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-images\"></i> slides</a>`{=html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNot long after the group's founding, both Ella and Ben were pulled away\n\n## Present\n\n## Future\n",
