    "section": "",
    "text": "This project started out of the need for representation in data, as a Trans person I hardly see anyone post in the #TidyTuesday or any other #RStats tweet that includes Transgender people. The response I often get in response to why is the data only for cisgender people is that the data has only a gender binary. After seeing so many people in academia post gender binary posts despite that their institutions have LGBTQ students the anger for change started inside me. With the initial relaunch meeting the needs assessment included LGBTQ data, hence the impetus for making #TidyRainbow.\nSearching the internet for LGBTQ data was going to be a challenge, I knew that there are few countries that collect LGBTQ data and fewer places that are accessible. My goal was to include non-English data and did try in German, India and Thailand but as English being my native language and Google Translate goes only so far. Wanting to share that I was mindful in my search but ultimately went with English sources as they offered the path of least resistance.\nSearching the English speaking internet for data is hard, as there are few places that have data and it being accessible. Anyone knows that most people never go beyond page 2 in Google search, but I went to page 20 trying to find non-redundant data. On page one of Google, you find Kaggle has 2 datasets and few other websites but ultimately very little data. This is where you spend so much time scouring for where there is actual data and not just a news report citing something, we want actual data that has LGBTQ people.\nNormally I search on private mode but luckily I was searching in cookie tracking mode as I lost all of my work on the links I found when changes made to the repo happened. After tracking down all the links I found I came up with a list and started to pull data down from the European Union Freedom Rights Association which has 30 questions and over 10 topics, each dataset being hosted on their website. The data I pulled down and cleaned was a pain, as the website has “all” option or individually selecting the groups for the questions and by which factor. The “all” option only gives you the column labelled “all” which is not informative, as you can’t make a difference between each group in the LGBTQ data based on a factor. There is a few xlsx datasets available that are about questions regarding safety and being open in society in the collective EU.\nThe need for data extraction and searching continues, there are government websites and university studies that need to be looked at. The goal is to be the place for LGBTQ data that everyone can find and use for their data science needs. We need to be seen, we need to be represented in data science visualizations."

    "text": "Past: The RainbowR origin story\n“My wife is really interested in wine.” Little did Ella know, when she said this to Ben Ortiz Ulloa during a casual conversation at useR!2017, that the seed had been sown for the idea of RainbowR. It was in that moment that Ben realised that he was talking to a fellow gay person. useR!2017 was large - around 1000 attendees - and knowing that he had found someone with this in common made the scale of the conference less overwhelming. He had a sense of community within the larger R community.\nThe following day Ben broached Ella with the idea formalising an LGBTQ+ community for R users and she leapt at the idea. Along with Erin LeDell and a couple of other conference attendees that they knew to be part of this community, they pitched the idea to Heather Turner and Kevin O’Brien from R Forwards, who fully supported it.\nAfter the conference, Ben and Ella, with input from Erin (who came up with the name RainbowR) and Heather, quickly went about building the community, establishing the Slack group and twitter account. Soon there were 60 people in the Slack. Conversations started and members shared ideas and opportunities online and met in person at other conferences and events. There was a datathon, in collaboration with R Forwards and the Cardiff R User Group, for the Transgender Day of Rememberance in 2018.\nUnfortunately, not long after the group’s founding, both Ella and Ben were pulled away by other personal and profession commitments. By 2019 the Slack group had gone dormant and, the odd tweet aside, RainbowR had stalled."

Pretty much simultaneously, Ella was looking to revive the group. Because we both have links to Forwards, fortuitously Heather was able to connect us. Over the past couple of months, we’ve been busy readying the community for relaunch: we have this new website, a fresh Code of Conduct and a new sign-up form for the Slack.\nWe also ran an open Zoom call and, despite the short notice, were delighted that we had thirty people sign up and eighteen attend. It was great to see a lot of excitement for the group and the relaunch, to gather ideas for the future, and to hear the participants confirm our feeling that there is indeed a need for the RainbowR community within the broader R community.\nThere’s little point having a group without defining what it’s for. Our mission statement, which will form the basis of everything we do is\n\nto support, promote and connect LGBTQ+ people in the R community and to and spread awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism."
