## Past: The RainbowR origin story

"My wife is really interested in wine." Little did Ella know, when she said this to Ben Ortiz Ulloa during a casual conversation at useR!2017, that the seed had been sown for the idea of RainbowR. It was in that moment that Ben realised that he was talking to a fellow gay person. useR!2017 was large - around 1000 attendees - and knowing that he had found someone with this in common made the scale of the conference less overwhelming. He had a sense of community within the larger R community.

The following day Ben broached Ella with the idea formalising an LGBTQ+ community for R users and she leapt at the idea. Along with Erin LeDell and a couple of other conference attendees that they knew to be part of this community, they pitched the idea to Heather Turner and Kevin O'Brien from [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), who fully supported it.

After the conference, Ben and Ella, with input from Erin (who came up with the name RainbowR) and Heather, quickly went about building the community, establishing the [Slack group](https://rainbowr.slack.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ) account. Soon there were 60 people in the Slack. Conversations started and members used it both to share ideas online and meet in person at other conferences and events.

Not long after the group's founding, both Ella and Ben were pulled away
